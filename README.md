# Boxoffice-Mojo-Web-Scrape

An exercise in Absolute Frequency, Weighted Frequency and Relative Frequency by web scraping the all-time domestic box office results from box office mojo. This is modified from a Datacamp exercise.

Background on the metrics to be calculated:

Absolute Frequency - number of times that a value appears, essentially, it is the number of times a particular thing happens. - in Movie Titles how many times does the word 'Star' appear

Weighted Frequency - weights the individual value in terms of frequencies for each result in the 'value' content (overall frequency in the complete data set). - what is the value of 'Star' (how are we measuring)

Relative frequency - the result of dividing the absolute frequency of a certain value by the total number of data. - Weighted Frequency divided by Absolute Frequency (times 'star' appears / value(measure) of star)
